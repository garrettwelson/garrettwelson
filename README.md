### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Garrett

**Pronouns:** [He/him/his](http://pronoun.is/he)

I'm a software engineer at LinkedIn. I learned to code at Hack Reactor in Austin, TX. I'm an alumnus of Williams College, where I read a lot about political science.

I'm currently working on an updated personal site/blog that will be deployed at [welson.co](https://welson.co). After getting that online, I'll be blogging about learning CS topics as a non-CS grad, contributing to open source projects, and whatever else I'm working on at the moment.
