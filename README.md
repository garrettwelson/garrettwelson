### Hi there 👋 

I'm Garrett

**Pronouns:** [He/him/his](http://pronoun.is/he)

I'm a software engineer at LinkedIn. I learned to code at Hack Reactor in Austin, TX. I'm an alumnus of Williams College, where I read a lot about political science.

I'm currently working on an updated personal site/blog that will be deployed at [garrett.lol](https://garrett.lol). After getting that online, I'll be blogging about learning CS topics as a non-CS grad, contributing to open source projects, and whatever else I'm working on at the moment.

A few technologies I've been enjoying lately are:

* 🐹  Ember
* 🎈  Eleventy
* 💅  CSS
* 🚀  Astro
